His other books also serve similar purposes and, although most of his novels are not original works, he created a huge amount of work and a renewed interest in the past. He was awarded the Cultural Order of Merit in 1960, the Order of the Sacred Treasure and the Mainichi Art Award just before his death from cancer in 1962.

Scruples, which describes the glamorous and affluent world of high fashion in Beverley Hills, California, helped define a new supercharged sub-genre of the romance novel - the bonkbuster or \"sex-and-shopping\" novel. She also fundamentally changed the publishing industry by becoming one of the first celebrity authors through her extensive touring and promotion - \"a superstar of fiction\". Her later books included Princess Daisy (1980), Till We Meet Again (1988), Dazzle (1990) and Spring Collection (1996).
